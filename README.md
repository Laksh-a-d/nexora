🌆 Nexora – Smart Billboard Detection System
💡 Project Overview

Nexora is a Flutter-based mobile application integrated with a RESTful backend API designed to detect and report invalid or unauthorized billboards in cities.
The goal of this project is to reduce visual pollution, support environmental cleanliness, and help local authorities maintain a smart, sustainable urban infrastructure.

Users can capture and upload images of billboards, which are analyzed and verified through the backend system to determine their validity. The app provides real-time tracking, location tagging, and reporting functionalities.

🚀 Features

📸 Image Capture & Upload: Capture billboard photos using the Flutter app.

🌍 Geo-Location Tracking: Automatically records GPS coordinates for each report.

🧠 Verification System: Backend validates billboard authorization via database or API checks.

⚙️ RESTful API Integration: Handles user authentication, image uploads, and verification requests.

🗺️ Interactive Dashboard (optional): Displays mapped locations of invalid billboards.

🔔 Smart Alerts: Notifies authorities about detected or reported invalid billboards.
